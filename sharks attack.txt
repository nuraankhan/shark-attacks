the dataset showed different cases of shark attacks from all over. 
my question was : "what were the main causes for these attacks?"
i used tableau software to help represnt my findings.
firstly i looked at where the attacks were and whether or not they were fatal.
it seemed as most were not fatal but the attacks couldve led to fatality.

next i looked up the 3 most popular activities amongst where the shark attacks were located.
the top 3 were Surfing, Fishing and swimming. what was most common was fishing.
according to my knowledge(and watching discovery/ national geograohic channels) wherever theres fishing 
actiity, there is a high possibility of sharks being within that region.
wherever the fishing was located on the map in tableau, it was in the areas of the shark attacks/

i searched for a certain amount of countries to see if there were more than one type of shark species located there.
i could see that the most popular sharks are bull, white and tiger sharks (definitely not one of nemos friends)

finally i searched for the same set of countries with the types of incidents. Provoked meaning the shark was aggitated. Unporvoked meaning the shark
was not in a "frenzy".
